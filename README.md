## Favorite Episode
My favorite episode is **Season 4, Episode 13**:  It’s the season finale and a masterclass in suspense, bringing the Gus-Walter rivalry to a brutal and spectacular conclusion. The way Walter orchestrates Gus’s death with Hector Salamanca’s help is brilliantly executed, down to the iconic shot of Gus calmly adjusting his tie with half his face blown off. It’s both horrifying and symbolic, showing just how far Walter is willing to go to protect his empire.
